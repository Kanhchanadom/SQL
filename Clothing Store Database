#1In this SQL, I created my own store by selling 5 different types of clothing articles. The table includes 5 columns (i.e., shirt, pants, dress, jacket, and socks) and a total of 115 articles.
I'm querying a database to illustrate clothing articles ordered by prices in ascedning order. 

CREATE TABLE clothing 
(ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
Name Text,
Quantity INTEGER,
Prices Numeric);

INSERT INTO clothing VALUES (1, "shirt", 3, 10);
INSERT INTO clothing VALUES (2, "pants", 4, 20);
INSERT INTO clothing VALUES (3, "dress", 3, 50);
INSERT INTO clothing VALUES (4, "jacket", 5, 30);
INSERT INTO clothing VALUES (5, "socks", 5, 5);

SELECT *
FROM clothing 
WHERE prices  
ORDER by prices asc
